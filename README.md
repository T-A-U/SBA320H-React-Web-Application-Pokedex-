## SBA 320H - React Web Application Project
Built using React, JavaScript, DaisyUI( Which is an easy CSS framework to help create the UI, a mentor told me about this), CSS.

When building this app I didn't have to worry about a database so I only focused on the front end. I did the fetch requests first to get the data from the PokeAPI and then I tried to get that data to show up on my website. Then I used DaisyUI to make it look good. I had a lot of trouble along the way, but I figured it out.

To run the application, in your terminal run: export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
--

1 Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, REACT, and Redux Toolkit.
2 Hosted on Heroku or Netlify.
3 Frequent commits to GitHub.

    A README.md file in your GitHub repository with:
        Explanations of the technologies used.
        Explanations of the approach taken.
        A link to your live site.
        Usage instructions, if relevant.
        Unsolved problems.
        etc.
    Use AJAX to make a request to an external data source like OMDBapi, and insert some of the data retrieved into the DOM.



Honstly without help this couldnt be done yet for me.  Probelems/errors every which way. Had more commits too but forced re-something and it's empty now. 






























# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run: 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
